## SLAM by MATLAB


### The purpose

**In order to allow people who want to learn SLAM to complete the basic theory of SLAM without relying on ros,and no grid map.Only use point**


### How to use

**No need to use any toolbox, just move the program directly into MATLAB and run it**

### Question

**If you use MATLAB to form a raster map, it will be much faster. If you use MATLAB to directly form a point cloud map, since multiple points must be matched each time, if you continue to use multi-resolution ICP, the efficiency will be much slower. Therefore, the SLAM effect of the ICP tested this time was not as good as expected.**
